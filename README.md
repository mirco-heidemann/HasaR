Assess hail loss on buildings using radar data from MeteoSwiss. To estimate hail losses on buildings from radar data in a timely manner after an event, a two-step binomial-gamma model was developed. In a first step, a logistic regression is used to predict the probability of loss occurrence. For the case where a loss occurs, in a second step the expected loss amount is modeled with a gamma distribution. The relevant drivers for the expected probability in the binomial model and for the expected loss in the gamma model are exclusively derived from the information contained in the radar data of MeteoSwiss. For the model development, two major hailstorms were used, each of which caused building damage in the canton of Zurich exceeding CHF 15 million. The developed model was verified on three additional hailstorms and is able to reproduce the actual loss amounts.
